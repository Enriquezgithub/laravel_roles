        We recently announced a beta for AI features in Figma Design. In this email, we are sharing our approach to
        building AI features and what's next.

        To improve these features, we plan to start training AI models to understand design concepts, patterns, file
        structure, and tooling in Figma. Learn more about how your team can manage AI and our other updates below.
